# 8-bit Digital-to-Analog Converter (R-2R Ladder)

## Overview
An 8-bit Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) designed and implemented using an R-2R ladder network.
The project converts digital input values into proportional analog output voltages.

The DAC was physically implemented on a hand-etched PCB and tested for linearity and accuracy.

## Key Features
1. It consists of 8-bit resolution (256 levels)
2. It was implemented using an R-2R ladder network 
3. It is a linear digital-to-analog conversion
4. It is a low-cost and hardware-efficient design

## Working Principle
The R-2R ladder network uses only two resistor values (R and 2R) to generate binary-weighted voltage levels corresponding to digital input combinations.

## Implementation
1. The design was done using the resistor ladder network
2. Fabricated a hand-etched PCB
3. The output voltage levels were verified for different digital inputs

## Tech Stack
1. Circuit Design
2. PCB Design and Etching
3. Analog Electronics

## Note
This project was implemented as part of undergraduate coursework and focuses on hardware-level design and validation.
