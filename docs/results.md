# Testing and Observations

After fabrication, the DAC was tested by applying different
digital input combinations using the switches. The output
voltage was measured using a digital voltage display and a
multimeter.

As the digital input value increased, the output voltage
changed in a step-wise and approximately linear manner.
Each increment in the digital input resulted in a
corresponding increase in the analog output voltage.

Minor deviations from ideal values were observed, which can
be attributed to resistor tolerance, manual PCB fabrication,
and measurement limitations. Despite these factors, the
overall behavior closely matched the theoretical operation
of an 8-bit R-2R ladder DAC.

The results confirmed that the circuit successfully performs
digital-to-analog conversion with acceptable accuracy for a
hardware-based implementation.
